# Overview
For this assignment you should do two things.

The first is to research and learn about a web API or library. You should understand, what it does, how to use it to accomplish that task and have a basic idea about what kinds of problems you can run into and how to solve those problems. What this looks like for different APIs is going to be very different. However, do expect to put a fair amount of work into this stage even though it makes up a small portion of the description here.

The second thing you need to do is construct a web site which is a how-to guide on your particular API or library. Again, this is going to vary quite a bit based on library or API.

**Note, this is due in the middle of week 10. It is NOT due on the final Sunday of week 10.**

# Selecting An API
Historically students have had a lot harder time picking an API than they have actually writing the guide and get into the most trouble when a week has gone by and they still have not picked an API.

You need to pick an API or library which will allow you to write a significant amount of sample code in your how-to. If you are not writing a lot of code to demonstrate things then it is probably not technical enough. For example, [a color scheme generator](http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF) is a web related tool and is actually often quite useful in web development but it is NOT technical enough for the how-to guide. You can show a couple code samples about how to include the generated files in your site but that is about it.

In contrast [the Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetPlayerSummaries_.28v0001.29) lets you get information about current video games and users using the service via HTTP calls. Students have used this to produce [excellent how-to guides](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~riceand/cs494/howto/index.php) in the past. Note that most pages include a code sample and spend most of the page detailing that code sample.

If you are unable to come up with a how-to idea then I would recommend one of the following topics:

Emulating classes with private and public members with getters and setters using closures in JavaScript.

Accessing [employment information](http://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm) from the BLS

Using the Sass or Less CSS extensions.

# Content of the How-to
The how-to should focus on areas which are lacking in the official documentation. For example, if the documentation has a great getting started guide but lacks a reference for the more common functions or calls, you could write the reference documentation. Likewise if it has great reference but no getting started guide, you could write a getting started guide. If the documentation is amazing, then you should be able to get up to speed quickly and maybe combine the API and write about the process of, for example, writing a JavaScript library that leverages the API.

It should consist of roughly 1/4 code examples and 3/4 text explaining those examples or explaining general concepts. If you are working with a library that deals with the UI then obviously pictures will be a given and will substantially extend the length of the how to. If it were converted to a well formatted document it would usually take at least 5 pages to offer a reasonably thorough guide in a particular area.

It should start with a link to the official page where one can find the software and view the existing documentation.

You are welcome to use any thrid-party libraries (like Bootstrap for CSS or jQuery for UI interactions) or tools to make the site. We are not grading the how-to on its HTML. We are grading it based on the content. However, if the styling makes it very difficult to tell what is code and what is plain text, that will be difficult to read and could result in lost points. Likewise if you don't clearly list things which are in lists or use tables when displaying tabular data, those are issues that can also affect the readability of the how-to.

So while we are not grading on aesthetics, if they get in the way of understanding the content then that is a problem.

You should NOT simply paraphrase existing documentation. There is is already good documentation for installing, just link to that from your documentation, do not copy or paraphrase it.

You should fill in gaps or discuss problems that one might run into which are not addressed in the official documentation.

If you want to write about a very large framework or tool, try to focus on a small part of it so you can still have enough complex technical material to write about. If you focus on the big picture it is very easy to end up not needing to actually get into any meaningful implementation.

We want to see that you actually got the API or library up and running and did some coding with it.

You are encouraged to share these with each other as there are a lot of neat things out there and this will hopefully be a way for you all to discover and learn how to use some exciting new tools.
